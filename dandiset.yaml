description: 'Spontaneous neuronal activities were extracted from GCaMP and tagRFP
  images, covering nearly all neurons in the nematode C. elegans brain. Cell segmentation
  and tracking were performed using 3DeeCellTracker (https://github.com/WenChentao/3DeeCellTracker).
  Neuronal identity information was derived from NeuroPAL signals with the NeuroPAL
  Auto-ID software (https://www.yeminilab.com/neuropal) and manual corrections. During
  the data acquisition, worms were semi-restricted in a microfluidic device (https://www.nature.com/articles/nature06292).
  Note: There are occasional transient failures in neuronal tracking. We recommend
  researchers to use a moving median filter (e.g., Â±3) on the time series data to
  address this issue.'
